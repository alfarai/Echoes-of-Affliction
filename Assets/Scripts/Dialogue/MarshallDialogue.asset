  - Oh, Robert! Good to see you safe and sound boy!
  - I see that Dan isn't with you...
  - Well, I haven't particularly seen him either... I just do hope he's doing fine.
  - 'Oh, me? I haven''t seen my wife either. I cant even reach her because of the
    lack of signal. '
  - The bigger problem right now is food, which reminds me that I still have that
    burger back in my car.
